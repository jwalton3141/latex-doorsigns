Procrastination at its most productive.

See the ```example/``` directory to get started.

The ```\student``` macro is introduced in ```macros.tex``` to add names to the door sign. Arguments for each entry are passed as.```\student{column number (1 or 2)}{row number (1, 2, 3 or 4)}{name 1}{name 2}{path to image}```. If "name 2" is empty the names will be typeset on a single line. Otherwise, "name 1" and "name 2" are set on separate lines.

Compile twice to set background correctly.
